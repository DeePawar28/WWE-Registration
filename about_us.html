<h2>* <u>WWE</u> *</h2>
	
<p><blockquote><h4>On May 5, 2002, the World Wrestling Federation announced it was changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Although mainly caused by an unfavorable ruling in its dispute with the World Wildlife Fund regarding the "WWF" initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment.<br><br>

On April 7, 2011, WWE, via the WWE Corporate website, announced that the company was ceasing use of the full name World Wrestling Entertainment and would henceforth refer to itself solely as WWE, making the latter an orphan initialism. This was said to reflect WWE's global entertainment expansion away from the ring with the ultimate goal of acquiring entertainment companies and putting a focus on television, live events, and film production. WWE noted that their new company model was put into effect with the relaunch of Tough Enough, being a non–scripted program (contrary to the scripted nature of professional wrestling) and with the launch of the WWE Network (at the time scheduled to launch in 2012; later pushed back to 2014). However, the legal name of the company remains as World Wrestling Entertainment.</h4></blockquote>

<h2>* <u>WWE Performance Center</u> *</h2>

<blockquote><h4>The WWE Performance Center is the official professional wrestling school system of the American professional wrestling promotion WWE. WWE currently operates two Performance Center locations, which serve as training facilities for WWE wrestlers, as well as sports science and medical facilities. The first branch, located in Orlando, Florida, and was opened on July 11, 2013. The second branch, located in Enfield, London, opened on January 11, 2019.<br><br>
The Performance Center is home to WWE’s talent developmental system, NXT. The facility covers 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) and includes seven training rings (including a special padded ring for high-flying moves), a strength and conditioning program, edit and production facilities including an ultra-slow camera, and a voice-over room that performers and on-air announcers can use to practice. The facility was opened in 2013 and replaced the training center at WWE's former developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), which was based in Tampa and had been serving as WWE's developmental headquarters since 2008.

The Performance Center trains around 65 to 70 wrestlers at any one time. Trainees have a variety of experience levels, from beginners from non-wrestling backgrounds to experienced wrestlers from the independent circuit. Wrestlers train to improve their in-ring performance, strength and conditioning, as well as working on their characters and personality. Upcoming referees, ring announcers, commentators, and backstage interviewers also train at the Performance Center. The trainees train full-time, while also performing at weekly NXT house shows and appearing on NXT television. In addition, established WWE Superstars often use the facility for training and injury rehab while mentoring new trainees.

<h2>* <u>WWE NXT</u> *</h2>

<blockquote><h4>WWE NXT, is a brand of the U.S. based professional wrestling promotion WWE.
While its primary purpose is to serve as a farm system for WWE's main roster (the Raw and SmackDown brands), NXT has come to be viewed by wrestling pundits and fans as its own distinct entity, becoming a brand in its own right. Originally holding its shows primarily in the Orlando, Florida area, NXT expanded its reach as time has gone on, having embarked on national and international tours, being praised for its high quality of wrestling and captivating storylines.NXT was formed in 2010 following the dissolution of the ECW brand. In February 2010, WWE debuted the NXT television program, the program featured rookies from WWE's Tampa, Florida-based developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) competing to become members of WWE's main roster. In June 2012, WWE ceased operating FCW, instead running all of its developmental events and operations at Full Sail University under the WWE NXT banner.

On February 27, 2014, NXT held its first live two hour special event called NXT Arrival, which was also the first live in-ring program broadcast on the WWE Network. Eventually, WWE scheduled more live two-hour special events, which have since become a regular fixture on WWE Network.
