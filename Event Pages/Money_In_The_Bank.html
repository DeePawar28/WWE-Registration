	<h2>* <u>WWE Money In The Bank</u> *</h2>
	
	<p><b><blockquote>Money in the Bank is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced annually by WWE. It is named after the Money in the Bank ladder match, which previously only took place at WrestleMania. The Money in the Bank ladder match debuted at WrestleMania 21 in 2005. The Money in the Bank match would then be held at the next five WrestleMania events, after which the match concept was spun off on to its own pay-per-view beginning in 2010.The "Money in the Bank" pay-per-view centers around a ladder match, the prize of which is a briefcase containing a contract for a championship match. The winner can then cash in the contract at a time and place of their choosing anytime within the next year – beginning the night they win the briefcase – for a world championship match. If the contract is not used within that year, it is voided, but this has yet to happen.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>In 2010 and 2011, the annual pay-per-views included two Money in the Bank ladder matches. One ladder match was for the Raw brand with a contract for a WWE Championship match, while the other ladder match was for the SmackDown brand with a contract for a World Heavyweight Championship match. The brand split ended in August 2011, after which, the Money in the Bank pay-per-views continued to have two ladder matches for contracts for the respective titles, but they were not brand exclusive. After the two titles were unified in December 2013, a championship match contract for the unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship became the prize of a single Money in the Bank ladder match. The brand split returned after the 2016 event, but the 2017 pay-per-view was SmackDown-exclusive. The championship match contract in the ladder match was for SmackDown's WWE Championship (formerly WWE World Heavyweight Championship). The 2017 event also featured the first-ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match with its contract being for a SmackDown Women's Championship match.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>The event became dual branded beginning with the 2018 pay-per-view, involving both the Raw and SmackDown brands. There are now two Money in the Bank ladder matches, one for men and one for women, each having eight participants evenly divided between the brands. The contract in each grants the winner a championship match for their respective brand's world championship: Raw's Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship, and the Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship. In 2019 though, the winner of each match could choose the championship to challenge for.</blockquote><br>
