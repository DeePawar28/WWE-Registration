	<p><b><blockquote>WWE Hell in a Cell is a professional wrestling event produced annually by WWE, a Connecticut-based professional wrestling promotion, and broadcast live and available only through pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network. The event was established in 2009, replacing WWE No Mercy in the early October slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. In 2012, WWE announced that Hell in a Cell will be moving to late October, leaving only one pay-per-view in October. However, in 2013, WWE added Battleground (originally as Over the Limit) in an early October slot. In 2018, the Hell in a Cell moved to the September slot.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>With the brand extension reinstated in 2016, the pay-per-view in 2016 was a Raw branded event. However, the 2017 edition of the event was recently hosted by SmackDown. In 2018, it was announced that Hell in a Cell would be a dual brand event.The concept of the show comes from WWE's established Hell in a Cell match, in which competitors fight inside a 20-foot-high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. Each main event match of the card is contested under the Hell in a Cell stipulation. </blockquote><br>

<blockquote>Hell in a Cell was chosen over No Escape, Locked Up and Rage in a Cage.Championship bouts are scheduled on every card, with the lower-tier titles contested on the undercard and the top-tier appearing on the main card.The concept of this pay-per-view is that all the main event matches would be fought inside a 24-foot-high roofed cell structure surrounding the ring and ringside area. In a Hell in a Cell match, there are no disqualifications or count-outs (also no escape). The only way to win is by pinfall or submission inside the ring.</blockquote><br>
