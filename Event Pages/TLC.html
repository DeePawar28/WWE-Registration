	<h2>* <u>WWE Tables Ladders & Chairs</u> *</h2>
	
	<p><b><blockquote>TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs is a professional wrestling event produced annually by WWE, a Connecticut–based promotion, and broadcast live and available through the WWE Network and pay-per-view (PPV). The event was established in 2009, replacing Armageddon in the December slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. The concept of the show is based on the primary matches of the card each containing a stipulation using tables, ladders, and chairs as legal weapons. The event's concept was voted by fans via WWE's official website and was chosen over an event with street fight main events and an event featuring a single-elimination tournament.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>Championship bouts were scheduled on every card, with the lower-tier titles featured on the undercard and the top-tier featured on the main card. The 2014 event was also referred to as Tables, Ladders, Chairs... and Stairs, because the first ever Steel Stairs Match, between Erick Rowan and Big Show, was contested at the event. With the brand extension reinstated in 2016, the pay-per-view in 2016 was a SmackDown branded event. In the 2017 edition of the event, it was moved from its usual December slot to an October slot together with making the event as a Raw branded event, allowing TLC to occur before the annual Survivor Series event that is held in November. Notably, the 2017 edition of the event also featured an interpromotional match with a wrestler from the SmackDown brand, since the original competitor scheduled for that event was unable to perform at the time due to viral infection. In 2018, it was announced that TLC would be a dual brand event, and was moved back to the December slot due to the cancellation of Clash of Champions.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>The concept of this pay-per-view is that the main event matches have stipulations that involve legally using tables, ladders and chairs. In 2010, every match involved tables, ladders, or chairs. During the show, there were Tables matches, Ladder matches, Chairs matches, and TLC matches. In a tables match, the only way to win is to put your opponent through a table. In a ladder match, the only way to win is to climb the ladder and retrieve the item above the ring. In a chairs match, the only way to win is by pinfall or submission in the ring, while using a chair as a legal weapon. In a TLC match, the same rules apply as a ladder match, but tables and chairs can also be used.</blockquote><br>
