	<h2>* <u>WWE Wrestlemania</u> *</h2>
	
	<p><b><blockquote>WrestleMania is a professional wrestling event produced annually between mid-March to mid-April by WWE, an American professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut. WWE first produced the event in 1985 and has since produced 35 editions, with the most recent having been held in East Rutherford, New Jersey on April 7, 2019. WrestleMania, WWE's flagship event, airs on pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network and is the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in history. It contributes to the worldwide commercial success of WWE through media, merchandise, and shows. WrestleMania was conceptualized by WWE owner Vince McMahon and long time WWE ring announcer and Hall of Famer Howard Finkel is credited with devising the name "WrestleMania" in 1984.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>WrestleMania centers on the main event matches, primarily for the WWE Championship - and additional world titles, such as the World Heavyweight Championship (2003-2013) and the WWE Universal Championship (since 2018) - as well as matches involving celebrities such as American footballer Lawrence Taylor or actor Mr. T. Other WWE championships are also contested for, while the match card also includes gimmick matches and matches involving personal feud.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>Since 1993, the winner of the annual Royal Rumble match has been able to receive a guaranteed WWE Championship match at the same year's WrestleMania. With the introduction of the World Heavyweight Championship in 2002, the winner was also given the option to choose between the world title or the WWE championship. The creation of the ECW brand in June 2006 gave the Rumble winner a third option: to choose to challenge for the ECW World Championship. This option was made available from 2007 until the brand was retired in 2010. However, this option was never chosen.[8] The brand split ended in 2011 and the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships were unified in 2013, leaving the former as the only title to challenge for until the reintroduction of the brand split in 2016, which added the WWE Universal Championship as a choice. A women's Royal Rumble match was introduced in 2018, and the winner has the option of challenging for either the WWE Raw Women's Championship or WWE SmackDown Women's Championship.</blockquote><br>
