	<p><b><blockquote>Survivor Series is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event held in November by WWE. It is the second longest running pay-per-view event in WWE history (behind WrestleMania) and one of the "Big Four" events, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble and SummerSlam, as it is one of the original four pay-per-views produced by WWE.The first Survivor Series, held in 1987, came on the heels of the success of WrestleMania III, as the then-WWF began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view market. The first event capitalized on the big time feud between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant, who wrestled each other at WrestleMania III.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>Survivor Series was originally created to be a "Thanksgiving tradition" as the first eight Survivor Series events took place on either Thanksgiving Day (1987–1990) or Thanksgiving Eve (1991–1994). Since 1995, the event has been held the Sunday before Thanksgiving (save for the 2005 and 2006 events, which were held after Thanksgiving). On February 11, 2010, WWE stated that Survivor Series would be rebranded, but in June, the event was added back onto WWE's pay-per-view schedule.With the return of the brand split in 2016, the 2016, 2017, and 2018 events have focused on direct competition between the two brands, Raw and SmackDown, similar to the Bragging Rights events that WWE held for two years during the first brand split. The theme of the 2017 and 2018 Survivor Series events in particular was brand supremacy; in addition to traditional Survivor Series elimination matches featuring Raw's men, women, and tag teams against SmackDown's, every champion of Raw faced their counterpart of SmackDown.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>The event is traditionally characterized by having tag-team elimination matches, pitting teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. These matches are generally referred to as "Survivor Series matches." The WWF had several elimination tag-team matches earlier in 1987, albeit with three-man teams and the feuds loosely related. In an early break from the norm, the 1992 event had only one tag team elimination match. The 1997 event saw the Montreal Screwjob, while the 1998 event was the first without any elimination tag team matches, instead focusing on an elimination tournament for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The 2002 Survivor Series (which also did not feature any elimination tag team matches) is notable for the debut of the Elimination Chamber match.</blockquote><br>
