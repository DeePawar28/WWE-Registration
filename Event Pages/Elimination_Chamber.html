	<p><b><blockquote>Elimination Chamber is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced by WWE, a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 2010, with its inaugural event taking place on February 21, 2010, replacing No Way Out. Elimination Chamber is a pay-per-view (PPV) event consisting of a main event and undercard that features championship matches and other various matches. The concept of the show is that one or two main event matches are contested inside the Elimination Chamber, either with championships or future opportunities at championships at stake.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>The first Elimination Chamber event took place on February 21, 2010 and aired live on PPV. The event's name was selected after WWE allowed fans to provide input via a survey on their official website and was chosen over Heavy Metal, Battle Chamber, Chamber of Conflict, and the original No Way Out name. Since its origin, each event has been held in an indoor arena, with all five taking place in the United States. In 2015, the event was replaced by Fastlane in the February pay-per-view slot. However, the 2015 event was later announced to be streamed exclusively on the WWE Network in the United States on May 31 and was also available on PPV elsewhere.</blockquote><br>

 <blockquote>WWE also confirmed that the newly vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship was being decided inside the Elimination Chamber. The event did not occur in 2016, but returned in 2017 as a SmackDown branded event for the first time. The 2018 edition was a Raw-branded event and included the first ever women's Elimination Chamber match, as well as the first seven-man Elimination Chamber match. The 2019 event was a dual-branded event and determined the inaugural holders of the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship.The Elimination Chamber match is generally contested by six participants, with two beginning the bout in the ring, while the other four are held within each inner chamber. Every five minutes, one of the four participants within a chamber is released into the ongoing match. This continues until all four have been released, and so an Elimination Chamber match typically lasts over twenty minutes. The objective of the match is to eliminate each opponent from the match by executing a pinfall or a submission, which can occur in the ring or even on the chamber's elevated floor (starting in the 2012 event, however, all pinfalls and submissions must take place in the ring). Disqualifications do not apply in the process of elimination. The winner of the match is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated.</blockquote><br>
